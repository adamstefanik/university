# First Year (2024-2025)

This folder contains all materials from my first year of university studies. It is organized by semesters and subjects.

## Semesters

### Spring Semester
- **Advanced Python Programming**: This course builds on the basics of Python and introduces advanced topics such as file handling, classes, and libraries like Numpy, Matplotlib, and Pandas. It also covers DevOps basics, including automated testing and documentation generation.
- **Programming in C**: This course focuses on the syntax and semantics of the C programming language, covering standards like ANSI C89, C99, and C11.

## How to Use
